# Presentation notes

## Intro

### The problem

Today,there's the issue where incorrect diagnosis in hospitals more than often leads to tragic deaths or adverse health effects, due to wide information gap between doctors and patients. 

PrescriptPal aims to bridge this gap. .

Although there is a wealth of knowledge on the internet, the problem is that there is too much information. This includes misleading and deceptive information, which as you can imagine can be detrimental.

### The app

PrescriptPals is a web app focused on bridging the information gap by simplifying, clarifying and ensuring prescriptions (particularly dosages) are correct. By making prescriptions available digitally as both the doctor and the patient having access to it, the patient is also provided with various reliable websites that they can access for more information whenever they need.


It does this in 2 ways.

1. Digitising prescriptions
2. Providing trusted sources to learn more about prescription and making the user aware if what they're taking is particularly dangerous in terms of side effects or dosages
